    <h1>The Evolution of Music Streaming, Reshaping the Melody of the Music Industry</h1>
    <h2>How streaming services changed the landscape of the music industry.</h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>In this new digital age, the resonance of music echoes far beyond the confines of traditional formats.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With the rise of music streaming platforms, the industry has undergone a shift, transforming the way we consume, produce, and perceive music.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From vinyl records to cassette tapes, CDs to digital downloads, and now streaming services, each era has changed the music industry. The uptick in music streaming platforms has heavily altered the landscape of the music industry over time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Soundcloud, have democratized access to music like never before. The convenience of streaming has led to a surge in subscribers globally, with millions of users tapping into vast libraries of songs at their fingertips. This shift from ownership to access has reshaped consumer behavior, paving the way for a more fluid and dynamic music experience. Large physical music libraries once took hundreds of dollars to create and access, the expenses of buying vinyl and cd players, individual albums, singles, and more. Now users can have access to almost all the music in the world for just a few dollars a month. Not only has music become more accessible for listeners, but it has also become more accessible for artists as well. The ability to upload original music and reach an audience has become exponentially easier with the technology of streaming platforms. On top of that, the creation of music has become easier with music making platforms such as Garageband that allow you to produce, record, and upload from the same device.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The rise of music streaming has also catalyzed cultural shifts in consumption patterns. With this ability to access millions of songs instantaneously, listeners are more inclined to explore diverse genres, discover new artists, and engage with music in novel ways. Often catering to shorter attention spans and on-the-go lifestyles. Furthermore, the communal experience of music has transcended physical boundaries, with collaborative playlists and social sharing becoming integral components of the streaming experience. Fanbases have become communities and streaming platforms and social media are their meeting spots.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sophomore Bandier student Olivia Friess states, “One good thing about streaming platforms is how easy it has become for users to discover new music and reach fellow listeners. It’s not just about what’s on the radio anymore, people are able to discover niches and sub-genres that otherwise would be impossible to find if you are not already involved in the scene.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Friess has been surrounded by music-makers her entire life, she is a part of University Union and WREW Radio, dabbled in music journalism, and continues to learn the ins and outs of the industry as a Bandier major at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While streaming has revolutionized music consumption, its impact on artist revenue has been a topic of debate. The shift from physical sales to streaming royalties has prompted concerns over fair compensation for artists. Friess shared that the main result has, “caused artists to have to find different ways to make money off their music… artists only get fractions of pennies for each stream of their song.” The outside revenue could be through brand partnerships, ad revenue, or releasing their own line of products as we’ve seen with artists such as Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Rhianna, and plenty more. In the digital age artists have to get creative with their income.</p>
    <br>
    <p>According to a data set published by informationisbeautiful.net in 2018 artists need approximately 336,000 streams on Spotify to earn minimum wage. This statistic varies from platform to platform as seen below, along with the average price earned per stream.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Yet despite the menial pay, for newer artists, streaming platforms are an extremely accessible way to gain exposure to an audience. With platforms like Spotify including personalized playlists powered by AI algorithms; artists can reach audiences beyond borders without the need for traditional gatekeepers, according to Bill Werde. Werde is the director of the Bandier Program at Syracuse University and previously served as editorial director for Billboard. He states, “streaming platforms have eliminated the gatekeepers and third party communicators between rising artists and their audience.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>This democratization of exposure has let independent musicians thrive in an industry once dominated by major labels, fostering a more diverse and inclusive musical landscape. According to Spotify’s Annual Music Economics Report, “Of the 23,400 artists who generated $10,000 in 2017, nearly half generated more than $50,000 in 2023 and likely $200,000 overall across all recorded revenue sources.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, some may argue; that there is so much visibility, that artists feel the need to pump out music in large quantities over focusing on honing in on their craft and releasing quality music. The business model of streaming platforms alludes to the “more streams = more money” mentality.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Friess shared that the musicians she interacts with are fortunate enough to be on a college campus with live music opportunities. Explaining that because of these opportunities they don’t feel the pressure of releasing quantity over quality music because they make the majority of their income through live music events. She also shared that, “these musicians have grown up around music and have developed a passion for it since childhood.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Werde agreed, sharing that if an artist is really passionate about what they produce they “won’t be pressured to release music that they don’t feel connected to.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Driven by the demand for constant content and need to stay relevant in an ever-changing market, artists often churn out tracks at a rapid pace. This approach risks diluting the potency of their work, leaving listeners craving the substance and authenticity that comes with a well crafted piece. However, amidst the pressure to produce, some artists manage to strike a balance, delivering both quantity and quality, enriching their audiences.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Werde argues that we are at the beginning of what he would call, “the post streaming era.” Explaining that streaming has slowed down in the majority of countries that account for the global revenue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>He states, “Now all the major labels and the biggest artists are trying to figure out what ‘next’ looks like.” Growth is starting to slow in that market. “Almost everyone is subscribed to a service already,” there’s not much novelty for consumers anymore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Looking ahead as we navigate the evolving landscape of the music industry; it is essential to recognize its impact From reshaping artist-consumer relationships to redefining revenue models and cultural norms, streaming has ushered in a new era of musical innovation and accessibility. As technology continues to advance and consumer preferences evolve, the melody of the music industry will continue reflect the societal changes around it.</p>
